To check the money tracker:\nLog in to your Wise account\nLog in to your Wise account\nClick Details on the transfer you\u2019d like to track\nClick Details on the transfer you\u2019d like to track\nToday, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.\nWe might need to verify you\nDepending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.\nThe recipient\u2019s bank might be processing the transfer\nWhen the money tracker says Transfer Sent, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient\u2019s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you\u2019re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.\nThere\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details\nSometimes, transfers get delayed because there\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they\u2019ll send the money back to us and we\u2019ll ask you to send it again.\nIf your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient\u2019s details. Here\u2019s what to do if you made a mistake.\nIt's a weekend or holiday\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\nWhat do I do now?\nIf we have paid out your money, but it hasn\u2019t settled in your recipient\u2019s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient\u2019s bank.\nGo to\u00a0Home to see your activity list\nGo to\u00a0Home to see your activity list\nClick on Details on the relevant transfer\nClick on Details on the relevant transfer\nClick Get PDF receipt\nClick Get PDF receipt\nSend the PDF to your recipient\u2019s bank\nSend the PDF to your recipient\u2019s bank\n",

    "content": "When you make a transfer, we\u2019ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it\u2019ll arrive, or why it\u2019s delayed.\nWise says that my transfer\u2019s due to arrive today.\nGreat! Really that means your money should\u2019ve arrived already. We say that it\u2019s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.\nMy recipient\u2019s details may be\u00a0wrong.\nSmall things like typos in names \u2014 for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time.\u00a0However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.\nIf something like an account number is\u00a0wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we\u2019ll let you know straight away.\nTransfers on weekends and holidays.\nNot all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you\u2019re sending money to.\nBut in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.\nThat means, if your money\u2019s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient\u2019s account until the next working day. We\u2019re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.\nMy recipient says the money hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\nWe hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven\u2019t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:\nThe sender name they\u2019re looking for.\u00a0Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\nThe sender name they\u2019re looking for.\u00a0Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name.

    "title": "Why do some transfers take longer?",
    "content": "We try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes, and what to do.\nWe\u2019ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive, and send you updates via email once the transfer is on its way. Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.\nTrack your transfer to see the latest status.\nPayment method\nHow you paid for your transfer can affect how long it takes to send, because some options are faster than others. We\u2019ll always show you how long each payment method takes when you\u2019re setting up your transfer. Conversion between currencies can always take up to 2 working days.\nPaying by card\nIf you paid by card, we can start your transfer straight away, because card payments are usually instant. They might sometimes be pending, so you can check your transfer status by logging into Wise.\nPaying by bank\nBanks can take longer depending on your currency. For example, it might take 2 working days to process your transfer, and longer if it falls on a holiday.\nPaying by Swift\nIf you make a Swift transfer, which is a global payment that uses multiple banks, we\u2019ll need to wait until we get your money. This could take 2\u20135 working days, and we can\u2019t control the speed as other banks are involved.\nPayment methods are also different for different currencies. Some currencies are faster than others, so read our Help Centre articles on your currency to find out how long yours can take.\nLearn more about Swift transfers\nWeekends and holidays\nOnce we\u2019ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control \u2014 so this might slow down the process.\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\nSo if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.\nMistake in your recipient details\nWe all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.\nSecurity checks\nFrom time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.\nYou can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.\nBanks processing payments\nAfter we send your money out to your recipient\u2019s bank, the bank will then process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others \u2014 it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money\u2019s out of our system, so we can\u2019t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.\nYour recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can\u2019t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly.\nWe\u2019re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you\u2019d like to help, you can let us know when the money arrived.",

    "title": "Sending with Swift",
    "content": "If you're sending a payment in a currency that's different from your recipient's bank's currency, you'll need to send it by Swift. An example is if you're sending USD to a country outside of the US.\nSwift payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent with the Swift international payment network.\u00a0The Swift international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via Swift payment.\nFind out how to send to recipients with Swift, what the fees are, and how long it can take.\nWhen do you use Swift?\nWe pay out via Swift when you send:\nUSD to countries outside the US\nUSD to countries outside the US\nGBP to countries outside the UK\nGBP to countries outside the UK\nMore than 1 million JPY to any country\nMore than 1 million JPY to any country\nEUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA\nEUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA\nWhat do I need to know when sending Swift?\nHere's a few things that can help make your transfer experience smoother.\nWhen sending out a Swift payment, always use an IBAN when possible. You can use our IBAN checker to see if a country supports IBAN numbers and what its structure means.\nIf you've sent a Swift payment to a recipient in the past, you can select them from the available recipients list when setting up your payment.\nFirst, always ask your recipient to double-check the details they're giving you are correct before you use them.\nOur system then uses recipient validation to check that the details are valid and comply with Swift rules. When you start setting up the payment, the system checks the name, address, bank account number, and the Swift or BIC number of your recipient. This helps us prevent rejected transfers or delays with your payments and give you a better Swift experience.\nIt's easy to type information into the wrong field. But this can lead to errors and delays. For example, in the account number field, only input the account number \u2014 not any additional details, like your recipient's name or Swift code.\nMake sure you don't use any spaces or separators in the number.\nWhat are the fees for Swift payments?\nWe\u2019ll charge you to send out a Swift payment \u2014 check our pricing page on the latest fees for your region.\nWhen the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their own handling fees.\u00a0We can't control what extra costs other banks apply.\nLearn more about correspondent bank fees\nHow long can a Swift transfer take?\nSwift payments usually take 1\u20136 working days to reach their destination, but it's possible they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.\nMy recipient's account details didn't work\nIf the system spots incorrect details, it'll prompt you to review them before continuing with the payment.\nThere are some unique account numbers that sometimes don't work with our system. If you're sure it's a valid number \u2014 contact us with a proof of account from your recipient. We'll try to create a custom rule for your situation. A proof of account validity can be an invoice or statement from the recipient's bank that shows the bank account number.\n*The speed or your transfers always depends on individual circumstances, and may not be available for all transactions",

If you cancel at this point, it can still take a few business days for the money to be refunded into your account, as it has to arrive at Wise before we can refund it.\nFor more information on how long refunds take, please see the relevant page for the currency that you have sent.\nYou may be able to cancel the transfer yourself. At this point your money is with us for conversion but if you can still see the Cancel transfer button, you can use it and cancel the transfer.\nBut, if you can\u2019t see it, you\u2019ll need to get in touch so we can cancel it.

    "content": "Every transfer will take a different amount of time depending on a few things. We always move your money as quickly as possible, but the speed will be affected by things like the currency you\u2019re sending to and from, how you pay for it, and banking hours.\nTo get a general estimate, you can put some currency details into our transfer calculator while logged in and it\u2019ll show you how long it might take.\nWhen you actually set up your transfer on Wise, your estimate will likely change \u2014 this is because the more information we have about your transfer, the more accurately we can tell you how long it\u2019ll take. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes.\nConversion\nWhatever currency you\u2019re sending, converting your money can always take up to 2 working days.\nThe countries you\u2019re sending to and from\nEvery currency and country is different. How quickly your transfer arrives to your recipient depends on how quickly your recipient\u2019s bank can process the payment, as well as the ways you paid in the country you\u2019re sending from.\nAfter the payment has been sent out of Wise, we can't confirm when the money has reached your recipient's bank, so you\u2019ll need to ask your recipient directly.\nHow you pay\nThe way you pay for your transfer can also affect the speed of your transfer. Some payment methods are quicker than others. For instance, card payments are normally instant, while bank transfers can take longer, especially if you\u2019re paying by Swift. We'll show you how long each payment method takes when you set up your transfer.\nPublic holidays and banking hours\nWe can only move your money during normal banking hours. So if you send money outside of those hours, it may take longer than usual. National holidays can also affect the transfer speed, so if you\u2019re sending to a different country, make sure to check that it doesn\u2019t fall on a holiday.\nSecurity checks\nAs a regulated institution, we also need to make sure we run regular security checks on our customers and their payments. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.\nYou can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.",

    "content": "The easiest way to see the exact pricing is to set up a transfer \u2014 we'll calculate everything for you and show you up front what you're paying.\nOur prices vary depending on what currency you\u2019re sending from and how you pay for your transfer \u2013 for example Wire, ACH or your Wise balance.\nIf we predict you won\u2019t be charged a correspondent fee, we\u2019ll charge between 1-16 USD* depending on how you pay\nIf we predict you won\u2019t be charged a correspondent fee, we\u2019ll charge between 1-16 USD* depending on how you pay\nIf we predict you\u2019ll be charged a correspondent fee, we\u2019ll charge\u00a0between 3-37 USD* depending on how you pay and where you're sending to\nIf we predict you\u2019ll be charged a correspondent fee, we\u2019ll charge\u00a0between 3-37 USD* depending on how you pay and where you're sending to\nCheck where you can send USD to\n*Note: some payment methods or currency conversions have percentage fees that may increase the fee. Check the tables below for detailed info.\nHow does Swift work?\nSending money with the Swift payment messaging network is like travelling from one airport to another \u2014 it\u2019s not always possible to take a direct flight, so you may need to travel from city to city via several connecting flights.\nSwift works the same way. The money will travel from one country to another through correspondent banks. These correspondent banks often charge their own fees.\nWe\u2019ve built a prediction tool based on the correspondent banks\u2019 historical fees and speed. If it suggests your payment will be charged, we include the fee when calculating your transfer cost.\nOn this page we show you our fees in USD for easy comparison. Keep in mind that we\u2019ll always take the fees in the currency you\u2019re sending from. So, if you\u2019re paying in EUR, we\u2019ll charge the fees in EUR as well, but it'll be equivalent to the USD fees we calculated.\nIf we predict you won\u2019t be charged a correspondent fee\nBased on how you send us the money and the currency it\u2019s in, we\u2019ll charge you the following:\nExample: you send 3,900 USD to China. You pay for this transfer with a USD Wire transfer. We then predict that you won\u2019t be charged a correspondent fee, so the cost of your transfer will be 17.41 USD.\nThe fee would be different if you select ACH to pay for the transfer. If\u00a0you used this method, the cost of your transfer would be 11.31 USD (11.30 USD + 0.28% * 3,900 USD = 22.22 USD).\nIf we predict you\u2019ll be charged a correspondent fee\nThe fee we charge depends on the country you're sending money to.\nBelgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vietnam.\nBased on how you send us the money and the currency it\u2019s in, we\u2019ll charge you the following:\nExample: you send 3,900 USD to Taiwan. You fund this with a GBP bank transfer. We then predict that you\u2019ll be charged correspondent fees, so your transfer will cost 35.89 USD (21.07 USD + 0.38% * 3900 USD = 35.89 USD).\nBased on how you send us the money and the currency it\u2019s in, we\u2019ll charge you the following:\nExample: you send 3,900 USD to Hong Kong and you fund it with an AUD bank transfer. It will cost 19.7 USD (4.10 USD + 0.40% * 3,900 USD = 19.7 USD).\nThe fee depends on where they bank, as well as on how you send us the money and the currency it\u2019s in.\nExample: you send 2,000 USD to Singapore and they have an account with DBS. You fund this with a USD ACH transfer. It'll cost 16.17 USD (10.57 USD + 0.28% *2,000 USD = 16.17 USD).\nThe fees depend on whether the recipient has a PrivatBank account. Check the two tables below to compare.\nWith PrivatBank account\nWithout PrivatBank account\nExample: you send 1,000\u00a0USD to Ukraine and the recipient account is with PrivatBank. If your funding method is Bank Transfer and your funding currency is EUR, it'll cost 19.54 USD ( 1.64 USD + 1.79% * 1,000 USD = 19.54 USD).\nWe'll charge the following fees, based on how you send us the money and the currency it\u2019s in. See exceptions below and read more about it here.\nExample: you send 3,900 USD to China . You fund this with a EUR bank transfer. We then predict that you\u2019ll be charged a correspondent fee, so the cost of your transfer is 28.78 USD (8.89 USD + 0.51% * 3,900 USD = 28.78 USD).\nWhat about FFC payments?\nWe can\u2019t send For Further Credit (FFC) payments. FFC is a payment made to a beneficiary that is not final. This means you can't send money to a recipient who will then forward the money somewhere else. These transactions require a separate field for entering the actual final recipient, and we don't have that option.",

    "title": "What are Swift correspondent fees when sending and receiving money?",
    "content": "When you send money to a bank account outside of its originating currency, for example sending USD to the UK, it usually goes through the Swift network. This is a network of banks that help process the payment until it gets to your destination country.\nSending money via Swift is a bit like travelling from one airport to another \u2014 it\u2019s not always possible to take a direct flight to the city you're traveling to, so you may need to take connecting flights. Swift works the same way.\nWhat are correspondent fees?\nCorrespondent fees are fees that correspondent banks charge you in the Swift network.\nThe money will travel from one country to another. And if the sender's bank and the recipient's banks don't have a direct relationship, the money will also travel from bank to bank. These banks are usually called correspondent banks. The banks often charge their own fee, which we call correspondent fees, and these will impact the amount the recipient gets.\u00a0The banks in this network change, so they might not be the same banks every time.\nHow much can I be charged in correspondent fees?\nThe amount that other banks charge will vary, but we estimate anywhere between 15 and 50 USD or equivalent. The fee might be higher depending on the banks.\nYou\u2019ll see you\u2019ve been charged when:\nyou check this in the transfer receipt\nyou check this in the transfer receipt\nyou or your recipient receives less than what you expected\nyou or your recipient receives less than what you expected\nHow can I avoid losing money due to correspondent fees?\nUnfortunately, correspondent fees are just part and parcel of Swift payments. But we\u2019re taking action to make sure you and your recipients aren\u2019t left short-changed.\nSending money with Swift\nThis is how it looks when you set up a transfer with Swift \u2014 for example, if you want to send USD outside of the US, GBP outside of the UK, or EUR outside of Europe.\nYou set up a transfer to your recipient with your bank or your financial provider\nYou set up a transfer to your recipient with your bank or your financial provider\nIf the bank or financial provider doesn't have a direct connection to the recipient\u2019s bank, the money will go through a network of correspondent banks \u2014 these banks help move the money\nIf the bank or financial provider doesn't have a direct connection to the recipient\u2019s bank, the money will go through a network of correspondent banks \u2014 these banks help move the money\nThe money lands in the recipient\u2019s bank \u2014 the recipient's bank might also charge an own incoming transfer fee\nThe money lands in the recipient\u2019s bank \u2014 the recipient's bank might also charge an own incoming transfer fee\nThe correspondent fee can be deducted at any stage of this process. It could be an outgoing transfer fee charged by your own bank, an intermediary fee from a correspondent bank, or even an incoming fee charged by the recipient\u2019s bank. Wise doesn't set these fees.\nWe\u2019ve built a prediction tool based on the correspondent banks\u2019 historical fees and speed. If our tool suggests your payment might charged a correspondent fee, we\u2019ll include it when calculating your transfer cost.\u00a0Unfortunately, some banks still end up charging their own fees, so we can't guarantee that our tool will work with each payment.\nReturned payments\nIf the recipient's bank doesn\u2019t accept your transfer, the money will be returned to you. But you might not receive the full amount you originally sent. This is because correspondent fees, and any other charges incurred during the processing of your transfer, will have been deducted.\nThe specific fees and the amount deducted can vary depending on the banks involved and the terms of the transaction.\nYou\u2019ll see if the payment was made via Swift on your transfer receipt.\nReceiving money with Swift\nCorrespondent banks that help send money can sometimes deduct their own fees from the sender's amount \u2014 Wise can't change this. You can ask your sender to opt for the OUR charges \u2014 this option allows the sender to cover all the correspondent charges.",
