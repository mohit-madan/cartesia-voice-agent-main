It’s so you can see where your money is at every step. To check the money tracker:
Log in to your Wise account

Today, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.
We might need to verify you
Depending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.
The recipient’s bank might be processing the transfer
When the money tracker says Transfer Sent, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient’s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you’re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.
There’s a mistake in the recipient’s details
Sometimes, transfers get delayed because there’s a mistake in the recipient’s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they’ll send the money back to us and we’ll ask you to send it again.
If your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient’s details. Here’s what to do if you made a mistake.
It's a weekend or holiday
If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.
What do I do now?
If we have paid out your money, but it hasn’t settled in your recipient’s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient’s bank.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2941900/when-will-my-money-arrive,When will my money arrive?,"When you make a transfer, we’ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it’ll arrive, or why it’s delayed.
Wise says that my transfer’s due to arrive today.
Great! Really that means your money should’ve arrived already. We say that it’s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.
My recipient’s details may be wrong.
Small things like typos in names — for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith — shouldn’t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time. However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.
If something like an account number is wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we’ll let you know straight away.
Transfers on weekends and holidays.
Not all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you’re sending money to.
But in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.
That means, if your money’s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient’s account until the next working day. We’re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.
My recipient says the money hasn’t arrived yet.
We hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven’t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:
The sender name they’re looking for. Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.

Getting a receipt.
Your recipient’s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They’ll have the money in their system, but won’t have put it into your recipient’s account.
Our receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2977950/why-does-it-say-my-transfers-complete-when-the-money-hasnt-arrived-yet,Why does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet?,"We mark your transfer Complete when we’ve sent the money to the recipient bank. And we leave a little room in our arrival estimate for the bank to process and release it.
If your recipient says they haven’t yet received the money, there are two possible reasons why.
But some banks are slower than others — they might take up to 1 working day for them to release the money. So your money’s safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it. Your recipient can ask their bank to speed this up. They’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.
Learn how to download a transfer receipt
Your recipient might not recognise the transfer when it arrives in their account. Using the transfer receipt, we recommend they check:
The sender name and reference. Your recipient should look for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they won’t see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our banking partners. In this case, they can identify it from the reference number.

The currency and amount. Your recipient’s account might be in a different currency than the one you’ve sent them. In this case, their bank will convert the money again, and the amount might be different than expected.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2977951/why-do-some-transfers-take-longer,Why do some transfers take longer?,"We try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes, and what to do.
We’ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive, and send you updates via email once the transfer is on its way. Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.
Track your transfer to see the latest status.
Payment method
How you paid for your transfer can affect how long it takes to send, because some options are faster than others. We’ll always show you how long each payment method takes when you’re setting up your transfer. Conversion between currencies can always take up to 2 working days.
Paying by card
If you paid by card, we can start your transfer straight away, because card payments are usually instant. They might sometimes be pending, so you can check your transfer status by logging into Wise.
Paying by bank
Banks can take longer depending on your currency. For example, it might take 2 working days to process your transfer, and longer if it falls on a holiday.
Paying by Swift
If you make a Swift transfer, which is a global payment that uses multiple banks, we’ll need to wait until we get your money. This could take 2–5 working days, and we can’t control the speed as other banks are involved.
Payment methods are also different for different currencies. Some currencies are faster than others, so read our Help Centre articles on your currency to find out how long yours can take.
Learn more about Swift transfers
Weekends and holidays
Once we’ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control — so this might slow down the process.
If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.
So if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.
Mistake in your recipient details
We all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.
Security checks
From time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.
You can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.
Banks processing payments
After we send your money out to your recipient’s bank, the bank will then process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others — it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money’s out of our system, so we can’t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.
Your recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can’t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly.
We’re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you’d like to help, you can let us know when the money arrived.","[{'text': 'Learn more about Swift transfers', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift'}, {'text': 'These additional checks can add extra time', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977963/how-long-will-extra-checks-on-my-transfer-take'}, {'text': 'transfer receipt', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977946/how-do-i-download-a-transfer-receipt'}]"
https://wise.com/help/articles/2932689/what-is-a-proof-of-payment,What is a proof of payment?,"A proof of payment can be a receipt (either a scan, a photo or a PDF) or a screenshot from your online bank, clearly showing the following:
your details — we need to see your name and account number, and your bank’s name
your details — we need to see your name and account number, and your bank’s name

If you aren’t able to fit all of this information into one image, you can take 2 screenshots. They both need to show your bank account number to confirm the information is for the same account.
Proof of payment in Australia and New Zealand
If your bank is in Australia or New Zealand, we need more than just a screenshot of your online banking. We’ll also need a recent bank statement showing your name, date of issue, and bank details.
You can also just send us the bank statement, and not the online banking screenshot, if it shows all the details listed above.","[{'text': 'screenshot', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2954849/how-to-take-a-screenshot'}]"
https://wise.com/help/articles/2977938/whats-a-banking-partner-reference-number,What's a banking partner reference number?,"For every transfer you send with Wise, we give you a transfer number, which you can use if you need to get in touch with us.
For some transfers, we’ll also give you a banking partner reference number. It’s called this because we send out your money through local banking partners in each country.
How do I use the banking partner reference number?
Give the banking partner reference number to your recipient. They can use the banking partner reference number to see where the transfer is once it’s shown as completed on your Wise account.
The recipient will need to give this number to the recipient’s bank if they get in touch with them.
In different countries, banks might call it something else. For example, in India, banks sometimes call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number, or a transaction reference number.",[]

Whether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.
Log in to your Wise account
Log in to your Wise account
Go to Home to see your activity list
Go to Home to see your activity list
Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending

You can cancel your transfer if:

Your money’s on its way to us
Your money’s on its way to us
Your money’s being processed

We’ll send the money back to you, and you can set up another transfer using the correct bank details.
Learn how to cancel your transfer
Contact your recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or if your transfer is complete.
Our conversion process is fast and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once a transfer is marked as complete, the money is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. So if you don’t see the option to cancel:
Get in touch with the person you’re paying
Get in touch with the person you’re paying
Tell them how you got their bank details wrong

Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise
Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise
Tip: If the bank sends your money back to us, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct bank details, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.
If you’re paying by Swift and your recipient's bank returns the money to us, you can only get a refund. We’ll send you an email asking to choose between a refund to your Wise balance or external bank account.","[{'text': 'Learn how to cancel your transfer', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2971625/i-want-to-cancel-a-transfer-i-havent-paid-for'}, {'text': 'Swift', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2553074/paying-by-swift'}]"

When you turn on Interest, you can still spend and send your money at any time.
However, there’s a processing time of up to 2 working days when you transfer over 12,000 EUR in one day from Interest balances or Jars. This is to help us keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.
It can sometimes be much quicker than 2 working days — we’ll give you a delivery estimate when you set up your transfer.

It doesn't include spending with your card, ATM withdrawals, scheduled transfers, or direct debits.
Making multiple transfers
You can make multiple transfers in one day without processing time as long as the total is 12,000 EUR or less.
However, it works differently if you transfer multiple amounts that bring you over 12,000 EUR. For example, if you send 10,000 EUR in the morning and then 8,000 EUR later the same day:
the 10,000 EUR transfer should arrive without added delay
the 10,000 EUR transfer should arrive without added delay
the 8,000 EUR transfer will have an added processing time of up to 2 working days
the 8,000 EUR transfer will have an added processing time of up to 2 working days
If you’re transferring in a different currency
The daily limits will be the equivalent of your local currency for that day. For example, if you’re based in the EEA but need to transfer USD, your threshold will be based on our exchange rate for EUR to USD for that day.
Other things can affect the arrival time
The estimated arrival time for your transfer might also be affected by other things, such as the country you’re sending to and any required security checks. This is always the case with sending money with Wise.

Why we have this processing time
Unlike many other providers, we want you to have easy access to your invested money.
When you turn on Interest, you’re investing in units in a fund. When you transfer money, we need to sell some of these units to cover the transfer. This takes a couple of days though, so to help you transfer without delay we use Wise’s money while we sell your units.
By having this 2 working day processing time for transfers over 12,000 EUR, we can sell the correct portion of your share in the fund to cover the transfer. This helps us to keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.","[{'text': 'how to avoid unexpected processing time', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/4Ofx8VSTCypxbfo1rEUa5g/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-interest-transfers'}, {'text': 'Find out what affects transfer times', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-take'}]"

the 100,000 GBP transfer should arrive without added delay
the 80,000 GBP transfer will have an added processing time of up to 5 working days
the 80,000 GBP transfer will have an added processing time of up to 5 working days
If you’re transferring in a different currency
The daily limits will be the equivalent of your local currency for that day. For example, if you’re based in the UK but need to transfer USD, your threshold will be based on our exchange rate for GBP to USD for that day.
Other things can affect the arrival time
The estimated arrival time for your transfer might also be affected by other things, such as the country you’re sending to and any required security checks. This is always the case with sending money with Wise.

Why we have this processing time
Unlike many other providers, we want you to have easy access to your invested money.
When you turn on Stocks, you’re investing in units in a fund. When you transfer money, we need to sell some of these units to cover the transfer. This takes a couple of days though, so to help you transfer without delay we use Wise’s money while we sell your units.
By having this 5 working day processing time for transfers over 100,000 GBP, we can sell the correct portion of your share in the fund to cover the transfer. This helps us to keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.","[{'text': 'Find out how to avoid unexpected processing time.', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2NdFl9rnCXOd38zIL0wYgQ/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-stocks-transfers-uk-business'}, {'text': 'Interest transfers', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/6H57JNPrt8I590yAYJix7B/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-uk-business-customers'}, {'text': 'Find out what affects transfer times', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-take'}]"

https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift,Sending with Swift,"If you're sending a payment in a currency that's different from your recipient's bank's currency, you'll need to send it by Swift. An example is if you're sending USD to a country outside of the US.
Swift payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent with the Swift international payment network. The Swift international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via Swift payment.
Find out how to send to recipients with Swift, what the fees are, and how long it can take.
When do you use Swift?
We pay out via Swift when you send:
USD to countries outside the US
USD to countries outside the US
GBP to countries outside the UK
GBP to countries outside the UK
More than 1 million JPY to any country
More than 1 million JPY to any country
EUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA
EUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA
What do I need to know when sending Swift?
Here's a few things that can help make your transfer experience smoother.
When sending out a Swift payment, always use an IBAN when possible. You can use our IBAN checker to see if a country supports IBAN numbers and what its structure means.
If you've sent a Swift payment to a recipient in the past, you can select them from the available recipients list when setting up your payment.
First, always ask your recipient to double-check the details they're giving you are correct before you use them.
Our system then uses recipient validation to check that the details are valid and comply with Swift rules. When you start setting up the payment, the system checks the name, address, bank account number, and the Swift or BIC number of your recipient. This helps us prevent rejected transfers or delays with your payments and give you a better Swift experience.
It's easy to type information into the wrong field. But this can lead to errors and delays. For example, in the account number field, only input the account number — not any additional details, like your recipient's name or Swift code.
Make sure you don't use any spaces or separators in the number.
What are the fees for Swift payments?
We’ll charge you to send out a Swift payment — check our pricing page on the latest fees for your region.
When the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their own handling fees. We can't control what extra costs other banks apply.
Learn more about correspondent bank fees
How long can a Swift transfer take?
Swift payments usually take 1–6 working days to reach their destination, but it's possible they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.
My recipient's account details didn't work
If the system spots incorrect details, it'll prompt you to review them before continuing with the payment.
There are some unique account numbers that sometimes don't work with our system. If you're sure it's a valid number — contact us with a proof of account from your recipient. We'll try to create a custom rule for your situation. A proof of account validity can be an invoice or statement from the recipient's bank that shows the bank account number.

We have to do these checks because Wise is a regulated financial institution. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your transfer.
So, if your transfer is taking a little longer, don’t worry. If we need any extra information from you, we’ll get in touch. Just keep an eye on your email — including your spam inbox — for any messages from us. And you can check your transfer progress in the Activity section of your Wise account.

Sending to AUD

You can send up to 1.5 million AUD per transfer.
Once Wise receives and converts your money, it usually takes 0–2 working days to arrive in your recipient’s bank account. Conversion can take up to 2 working days.
We’ll always give you an estimate for how long your transfer will take when you set it up.

If you are sending money to Wise with Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), also known as Local or Domestic Telegraphic Transfer, check that the beneficiary details include the BSB code 774001 or 802985. RTGS transactions of any amount (subjected to your sender bank’s limit) can be accepted for account details with BSB code 774001. On the other hand, account details with BSB code 802985 can accept RTGS transactions that are more than 50,000 AUD.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2968916/sending-eur-to-countries-outside-of-europe,Sending EUR to countries outside of Europe,"With Wise, you can send euros (EUR) to bank accounts in countries outside of SEPA using Swift.
What’s a Swift transfer?
When you send a same-currency transfer, it’s sent via the Swift messaging network. An example would be when you send euros to a EUR bank account outside of SEPA — as opposed to it being converted to another currency.
How does Swift work?
Sending money with the Swift payment network is like travelling from one airport to another – it’s not always possible to take a direct flight, so you may need to travel from city to city via several connecting flights.
Swift works the same way. The money will travel from one country to another through correspondent banks. These correspondent banks often charge their own fees that are separate from our fees.
How to set it up
Set up your transfer on Wise. You’ll need to add a new recipient to get started.

Pay for your transfer. We’ll send the EUR to your recipient as usual.
How much it costs
It costs us extra to send money by Swift, so we’ll add that amount to the regular Wise fee. There may also be additional fees from correspondent or recipient banks when sending by Swift.
If you're converting from another currency to EUR we'll charge a conversion fee, but if you're paying with EUR and sending to EUR then we just charge a flat fee.*
Check the tables below for pricing. Your total fee will be the fixed fee plus the variable fee.
You'll see how much the extra fee is when setting up a transfer, but you can also check pricing here and review the Terms of Use for your region.
*If you're sending EUR outside of SEPA from your Wise balance, there's an additional 0.48 EUR fee.
Not applicable to business PrivatBank accounts.
When sending to EUR bank accounts to countries outside of SEPA the recipient's bank may charge fees to receive Swift payments.**
In addition, correspondent banks along the way might charge additional fees to process the money. We don’t have control over when these fees are charged, or how much they cost.
Learn more about Swift correspondent fees
**Note: if you're sending to a personal PrivatBank account in Ukraine the recipient bank won't charge additional fees.

Then you need to choose your bank and authorise a payment each time you pay with this method.
Here are some common questions about paying using your connected bank account (ACH) in the US.
How long does it take for my money to reach Wise?
It usually takes up to 4 working days for your money to reach us. And you’ll usually see the debit in your bank account within 2–3 working days of making the transfer.
Since it can take some time for the money to reach us, be sure you have enough money in your account while you wait for the debit.
Guaranteed Rate with your connected bank account (ACH)
When paying for a transfer or topping up your balance from your connected bank account (ACH), the guaranteed rate is secured once you have authorised the payment to Wise. With other payment methods generally the guaranteed rate is secured once Wise receives the money for your transfer.
Learn more about guaranteed rates
How much can I send?
You can send up to 50,000 USD per 24 hours. You can also send up to 250,000 USD over a 60 day period on your personal account and up to 400,000 USD on your business account.
Do I need to give my Social Security number (SSN)?
Depending on a number of factors, we might ask for your SSN. But no one in Wise has access to it.
If you don’t have an SSN, we’ll ask you why. You might be able to get verified with another form of US ID. But if you only have an ITIN, you have to use a non-US ID instead.
What happens if I cancel my debit from the connected bank account (ACH)?
You can cancel for a full refund 30 minutes after you’ve paid — unless the money’s already been paid out. If the money has already left your bank account, please wait for our refund. If the money hasn't left your account yet in over 30 minutes, you can still cancel any time.

Who can receive transfers that are paid from-CNY?
Due to regulations, you can only send CNY from China to another account you own.
This can be your bank account outside of China, or your Wise Account. You can add CNY to your Wise balance by following these steps.
How much can I send?
The limits are different depending on how you send.
If you're sending CNY from your China bank app, the maximum you can send in one transfer is 300,000 CNY.
If you are sending CNY from Alipay, the maximum you can send in one transfer is 50,000 CNY.
Aside from the single transfer limit, Wise also adheres to China’s regulations and applies a limit on how much you can send out of China. This is known as overall limit and it's calculated based on:
Your annual income
Your annual income
The amount of tax you have paid in China
The amount of tax you have paid in China
The number of years you've paid taxes on, proven through tax record(s) submitted.
The number of years you've paid taxes on, proven through tax record(s) submitted.
In general, your overall limit is the amount of salary you've earned in China after deducting the amount of tax paid in China.
Does this limit expire?
There is no expiry date for the limit. When you reach the limit, you'll be prompted to upload a new tax record when you set up your next transfer. Your limit will be increased after Wise has verified your newly uploaded tax record, and you will receive an email on your new overall limit too.
Note for Skyremit users: the amount you send via Skyremit will also impact your remaining balance and the limit on how much you can send out via Wise and vice versa.
How can I determine my sending limits?
Your remaining limit is the amount left after deducting both your successful and unfunded transfers from your total limit. For example, if your total limit is 100 CNY, and you’ve sent 50 CNY with an additional unfunded transfer of 20 CNY, your remaining limit would be 30 CNY.
If there are any unfunded transfers that you don't intend on funding, you can cancel them, and the corresponding amount will be added back to your remaining limit. The limit is based on the amount you transfer to Wise, not the amount that we send out (converted by Wise after deducting the fees from the amount transferred).
How can I pay for my CNY transfer?
After submitting your verification information and documents, you'll see 2 methods to pay Wise — bank transfer or Alipay. We'll review your information and documents after we've received your payment.

As of 2017, The Foreign Exchange Transaction (FET) forms have been discontinued.

First, check the status of your transfer by going to your account. If you still need to do something with your payment, you'll see it as a Task on your home page. Otherwise, it'll appear in your Transactions.
Then, match the status to the corresponding step below to see what you can do.
Payment statuses
You can cancel the transfer yourself at this step. Here's how to cancel your transfer:
While logged in, go to Home.
While logged in, go to Home.
Select the transfer you want to cancel and choose Cancel transfer.
Select the transfer you want to cancel and choose Cancel transfer.
If you’ve already selected I've now paid, you might need to re-enter your bank account details. Find out why you need to enter your bank account details.
Once this is done, you'll get an email from us confirming that your transfer has been successfully cancelled.
You can still cancel your transfer yourself at this step. Just follow the directions above to do so. You may also see a different message for the this step, like “Your money may still be in your bank account”, or “Sorry, we didn’t get the money yet”.
This is fine, you’ll still be able to see the Cancel transfer button underneath the transfer. If you cancel at this point, it can still take a few business days for the money to be refunded into your account, as it has to arrive at Wise before we can refund it.
For more information on how long refunds take, please see the relevant page for the currency that you have sent.
You may be able to cancel the transfer yourself. At this point your money is with us for conversion but if you can still see the Cancel transfer button, you can use it and cancel the transfer.
But, if you can’t see it, you’ll need to get in touch so we can cancel it. Our conversion process can be fast, so make sure to reach out as soon as possible. If we haven’t sent out the money yet, we can refund it back to you.
You won’t need to give us your bank account details if you paid for your transfer by credit or debit card. In this case, we’ll automatically refund the transfer to the card you paid with, and won’t ask for more information.
You won't be able to cancel your transfer if been sent out or completed.
If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.

Move money to a cash balance or Jar
You can have separate pots of money:
a separate Interest balance or Jar where you can earn a return
a separate Interest balance or Jar where you can earn a return
a balance or Jar without Interest, set to cash, which you can use to send large amounts quickly
a balance or Jar without Interest, set to cash, which you can use to send large amounts quickly
If you haven’t got a cash balance or Jar in the same currency, you can open one. To do this, select the Open button from your Wise account home screen.
Alternatively, you can just change your Interest balance or Jar to a regular cash one.
In the web or app:
Select Interest on your balance or Jar
Select Interest on your balance or Jar
Select Change this balance
Select Change this balance

Select Cash
It can take up to 2 working days to move money between Interest and cash, or to change your whole Interest balance or Jar to cash.
Transfer some money today, and some tomorrow
To avoid processing delays when transferring amounts between 12,000 EUR and 24,000 EUR, you can send 12,000 EUR whenever you want to send it and then send the remaining 12,000 EUR the following morning.
If you're sending more than 24,000 EUR then it'd be fastest to send it all in one transaction.
Transfer money the same day you add it
You can transfer any amount of money over 12,000 EUR without the processing time if you transfer it the same day you add or receive it into your Interest balance or Jar. This is because we don’t invest your money until the next working day at 7:00 am Dublin time.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-take,How long does a transfer usually take?,"Every transfer will take a different amount of time depending on a few things. We always move your money as quickly as possible, but the speed will be affected by things like the currency you’re sending to and from, how you pay for it, and banking hours.
To get a general estimate, you can put some currency details into our transfer calculator while logged in and it’ll show you how long it might take.
When you actually set up your transfer on Wise, your estimate will likely change — this is because the more information we have about your transfer, the more accurately we can tell you how long it’ll take. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes.
Conversion
Whatever currency you’re sending, converting your money can always take up to 2 working days.
The countries you’re sending to and from
Every currency and country is different. How quickly your transfer arrives to your recipient depends on how quickly your recipient’s bank can process the payment, as well as the ways you paid in the country you’re sending from.
After the payment has been sent out of Wise, we can't confirm when the money has reached your recipient's bank, so you’ll need to ask your recipient directly.
How you pay
The way you pay for your transfer can also affect the speed of your transfer. Some payment methods are quicker than others. For instance, card payments are normally instant, while bank transfers can take longer, especially if you’re paying by Swift. We'll show you how long each payment method takes when you set up your transfer.
Public holidays and banking hours
We can only move your money during normal banking hours. So if you send money outside of those hours, it may take longer than usual. National holidays can also affect the transfer speed, so if you’re sending to a different country, make sure to check that it doesn’t fall on a holiday.
Security checks
As a regulated institution, we also need to make sure we run regular security checks on our customers and their payments. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.
You can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.","[{'text': 'Swift', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2553074/paying-by-swift'}, {'text': 'These additional checks can add extra time', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977963/how-long-will-extra-checks-on-my-transfer-take'}]"

Our prices vary depending on what currency you’re sending from and how you pay for your transfer – for example Wire, ACH or your Wise balance.
If we predict you won’t be charged a correspondent fee, we’ll charge between 1-16 USD* depending on how you pay
If we predict you won’t be charged a correspondent fee, we’ll charge between 1-16 USD* depending on how you pay

Check where you can send USD to
*Note: some payment methods or currency conversions have percentage fees that may increase the fee. Check the tables below for detailed info.
How does Swift work?
Sending money with the Swift payment messaging network is like travelling from one airport to another — it’s not always possible to take a direct flight, so you may need to travel from city to city via several connecting flights.
Swift works the same way. The money will travel from one country to another through correspondent banks. These correspondent banks often charge their own fees.
We’ve built a prediction tool based on the correspondent banks’ historical fees and speed. If it suggests your payment will be charged, we include the fee when calculating your transfer cost.
On this page we show you our fees in USD for easy comparison. Keep in mind that we’ll always take the fees in the currency you’re sending from. So, if you’re paying in EUR, we’ll charge the fees in EUR as well, but it'll be equivalent to the USD fees we calculated.
If we predict you won’t be charged a correspondent fee
Based on how you send us the money and the currency it’s in, we’ll charge you the following:
Example: you send 3,900 USD to China. You pay for this transfer with a USD Wire transfer. We then predict that you won’t be charged a correspondent fee, so the cost of your transfer will be 17.41 USD.
The fee would be different if you select ACH to pay for the transfer. If you used this method, the cost of your transfer would be 11.31 USD (11.30 USD + 0.28% * 3,900 USD = 22.22 USD).
If we predict you’ll be charged a correspondent fee
The fee we charge depends on the country you're sending money to.
Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vietnam.
Based on how you send us the money and the currency it’s in, we’ll charge you the following:
Example: you send 3,900 USD to Taiwan. You fund this with a GBP bank transfer. We then predict that you’ll be charged correspondent fees, so your transfer will cost 35.89 USD (21.07 USD + 0.38% * 3900 USD = 35.89 USD).
Based on how you send us the money and the currency it’s in, we’ll charge you the following:
Example: you send 3,900 USD to Hong Kong and you fund it with an AUD bank transfer. It will cost 19.7 USD (4.10 USD + 0.40% * 3,900 USD = 19.7 USD).
The fee depends on where they bank, as well as on how you send us the money and the currency it’s in.
Example: you send 2,000 USD to Singapore and they have an account with DBS. You fund this with a USD ACH transfer. It'll cost 16.17 USD (10.57 USD + 0.28% *2,000 USD = 16.17 USD).
The fees depend on whether the recipient has a PrivatBank account. Check the two tables below to compare.
With PrivatBank account
Without PrivatBank account
Example: you send 1,000 USD to Ukraine and the recipient account is with PrivatBank. If your funding method is Bank Transfer and your funding currency is EUR, it'll cost 19.54 USD ( 1.64 USD + 1.79% * 1,000 USD = 19.54 USD).
We'll charge the following fees, based on how you send us the money and the currency it’s in. See exceptions below and read more about it here.
Example: you send 3,900 USD to China . You fund this with a EUR bank transfer. We then predict that you’ll be charged a correspondent fee, so the cost of your transfer is 28.78 USD (8.89 USD + 0.51% * 3,900 USD = 28.78 USD).
What about FFC payments?
We can’t send For Further Credit (FFC) payments. FFC is a payment made to a beneficiary that is not final. This means you can't send money to a recipient who will then forward the money somewhere else. These transactions require a separate field for entering the actual final recipient, and we don't have that option.","[{'text': 'Check where you can send USD to', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2974947/what-countries-can-i-send-usd-to'}, {'text': 'read more about it here', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2974947/what-countries-and-regions-can-i-send-usd-to-via-swift'}]"

These transfers incur an additional flat fee on top of our regular % fee. The flat fee differs depending on the currency you’re sending from, and you can see all of the fees below.
Our flat fees cover all usual Swift charges. So intermediary and beneficiary bank fees shouldn’t be charged on your transfer.

https://wise.com/help/articles/3KEJruODkhi59TZbSxO2xn/what-are-swift-usd-correspondent-fees,What are Swift correspondent fees when sending and receiving money?,"When you send money to a bank account outside of its originating currency, for example sending USD to the UK, it usually goes through the Swift network. This is a network of banks that help process the payment until it gets to your destination country.
Sending money via Swift is a bit like travelling from one airport to another — it’s not always possible to take a direct flight to the city you're traveling to, so you may need to take connecting flights. Swift works the same way.
What are correspondent fees?
Correspondent fees are fees that correspondent banks charge you in the Swift network.
The money will travel from one country to another. And if the sender's bank and the recipient's banks don't have a direct relationship, the money will also travel from bank to bank. These banks are usually called correspondent banks. The banks often charge their own fee, which we call correspondent fees, and these will impact the amount the recipient gets. The banks in this network change, so they might not be the same banks every time.
How much can I be charged in correspondent fees?
The amount that other banks charge will vary, but we estimate anywhere between 15 and 50 USD or equivalent. The fee might be higher depending on the banks.
You’ll see you’ve been charged when:
you check this in the transfer receipt
you check this in the transfer receipt
you or your recipient receives less than what you expected
you or your recipient receives less than what you expected
How can I avoid losing money due to correspondent fees?
Unfortunately, correspondent fees are just part and parcel of Swift payments. But we’re taking action to make sure you and your recipients aren’t left short-changed.
Sending money with Swift
This is how it looks when you set up a transfer with Swift — for example, if you want to send USD outside of the US, GBP outside of the UK, or EUR outside of Europe.
You set up a transfer to your recipient with your bank or your financial provider
You set up a transfer to your recipient with your bank or your financial provider
If the bank or financial provider doesn't have a direct connection to the recipient’s bank, the money will go through a network of correspondent banks — these banks help move the money
If the bank or financial provider doesn't have a direct connection to the recipient’s bank, the money will go through a network of correspondent banks — these banks help move the money
The money lands in the recipient’s bank — the recipient's bank might also charge an own incoming transfer fee
The money lands in the recipient’s bank — the recipient's bank might also charge an own incoming transfer fee
The correspondent fee can be deducted at any stage of this process. It could be an outgoing transfer fee charged by your own bank, an intermediary fee from a correspondent bank, or even an incoming fee charged by the recipient’s bank. Wise doesn't set these fees.
We’ve built a prediction tool based on the correspondent banks’ historical fees and speed. If our tool suggests your payment might charged a correspondent fee, we’ll include it when calculating your transfer cost. Unfortunately, some banks still end up charging their own fees, so we can't guarantee that our tool will work with each payment.
Returned payments
If the recipient's bank doesn’t accept your transfer, the money will be returned to you. But you might not receive the full amount you originally sent. This is because correspondent fees, and any other charges incurred during the processing of your transfer, will have been deducted.
The specific fees and the amount deducted can vary depending on the banks involved and the terms of the transaction.
You’ll see if the payment was made via Swift on your transfer receipt.
Receiving money with Swift
Correspondent banks that help send money can sometimes deduct their own fees from the sender's amount — Wise can't change this. You can ask your sender to opt for the OUR charges — this option allows the sender to cover all the correspondent charges.","[{'text': 'set up a transfer with Swift', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift'}, {'text': 'USD outside of the US', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2946451/sending-usd-to-countries-outside-the-us'}, {'text': 'GBP outside of the UK', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977936/sending-gbp-to-countries-outside-of-the-uk'}, {'text': 'EUR outside of Europe', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2968916/sending-eur-to-countries-outside-of-europe'}]"
