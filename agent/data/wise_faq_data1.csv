It’s so you can see where your money is at every step. To check the money tracker:
Log in to your Wise account

Today, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.
We might need to verify you
Depending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.
The recipient’s bank might be processing the transfer
When the money tracker says Transfer Sent, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient’s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you’re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.
There’s a mistake in the recipient’s details
Sometimes, transfers get delayed because there’s a mistake in the recipient’s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they’ll send the money back to us and we’ll ask you to send it again.
If your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient’s details. Here’s what to do if you made a mistake.
It's a weekend or holiday
If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.
What do I do now?
If we have paid out your money, but it hasn’t settled in your recipient’s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient’s bank.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2941900/when-will-my-money-arrive,When will my money arrive?,"When you make a transfer, we’ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it’ll arrive, or why it’s delayed.
Wise says that my transfer’s due to arrive today.
Great! Really that means your money should’ve arrived already. We say that it’s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.
My recipient’s details may be wrong.
Small things like typos in names — for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith — shouldn’t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time. However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.
If something like an account number is wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we’ll let you know straight away.
Transfers on weekends and holidays.
Not all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you’re sending money to.
But in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.
That means, if your money’s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient’s account until the next working day. We’re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.
My recipient says the money hasn’t arrived yet.
We hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven’t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:
The sender name they’re looking for. Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.

Getting a receipt.
Your recipient’s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They’ll have the money in their system, but won’t have put it into your recipient’s account.
Our receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2977950/why-does-it-say-my-transfers-complete-when-the-money-hasnt-arrived-yet,Why does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet?,"We mark your transfer Complete when we’ve sent the money to the recipient bank. And we leave a little room in our arrival estimate for the bank to process and release it.
If your recipient says they haven’t yet received the money, there are two possible reasons why.
But some banks are slower than others — they might take up to 1 working day for them to release the money. So your money’s safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it. Your recipient can ask their bank to speed this up. They’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.
Learn how to download a transfer receipt
Your recipient might not recognise the transfer when it arrives in their account. Using the transfer receipt, we recommend they check:
The sender name and reference. Your recipient should look for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they won’t see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our banking partners. In this case, they can identify it from the reference number.

The currency and amount. Your recipient’s account might be in a different currency than the one you’ve sent them. In this case, their bank will convert the money again, and the amount might be different than expected.

https://wise.com/help/articles/2977951/why-do-some-transfers-take-longer,Why do some transfers take longer?,"We try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes, and what to do.
We’ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive, and send you updates via email once the transfer is on its way. Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.
Track your transfer to see the latest status.
Payment method
How you paid for your transfer can affect how long it takes to send, because some options are faster than others. We’ll always show you how long each payment method takes when you’re setting up your transfer. Conversion between currencies can always take up to 2 working days.
Paying by card
If you paid by card, we can start your transfer straight away, because card payments are usually instant. They might sometimes be pending, so you can check your transfer status by logging into Wise.
Paying by bank
Banks can take longer depending on your currency. For example, it might take 2 working days to process your transfer, and longer if it falls on a holiday.
Paying by Swift
If you make a Swift transfer, which is a global payment that uses multiple banks, we’ll need to wait until we get your money. This could take 2–5 working days, and we can’t control the speed as other banks are involved.
Payment methods are also different for different currencies. Some currencies are faster than others, so read our Help Centre articles on your currency to find out how long yours can take.
Learn more about Swift transfers
Weekends and holidays
Once we’ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control — so this might slow down the process.
If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.
So if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.
Mistake in your recipient details
We all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.
Security checks
From time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.
You can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.
Banks processing payments
After we send your money out to your recipient’s bank, the bank will then process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others — it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money’s out of our system, so we can’t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.
Your recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can’t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly.
We’re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you’d like to help, you can let us know when the money arrived.","[{'text': 'Learn more about Swift transfers', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift'}, {'text': 'These additional checks can add extra time', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977963/how-long-will-extra-checks-on-my-transfer-take'}, {'text': 'transfer receipt', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2977946/how-do-i-download-a-transfer-receipt'}]"
https://wise.com/help/articles/2932689/what-is-a-proof-of-payment,What is a proof of payment?,"A proof of payment can be a receipt (either a scan, a photo or a PDF) or a screenshot from your online bank, clearly showing the following:
your details — we need to see your name and account number, and your bank’s name
your details — we need to see your name and account number, and your bank’s name

If you aren’t able to fit all of this information into one image, you can take 2 screenshots. They both need to show your bank account number to confirm the information is for the same account.
Proof of payment in Australia and New Zealand
If your bank is in Australia or New Zealand, we need more than just a screenshot of your online banking. We’ll also need a recent bank statement showing your name, date of issue, and bank details.
You can also just send us the bank statement, and not the online banking screenshot, if it shows all the details listed above.","[{'text': 'screenshot', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2954849/how-to-take-a-screenshot'}]"
https://wise.com/help/articles/2977938/whats-a-banking-partner-reference-number,What's a banking partner reference number?,"For every transfer you send with Wise, we give you a transfer number, which you can use if you need to get in touch with us.
For some transfers, we’ll also give you a banking partner reference number. It’s called this because we send out your money through local banking partners in each country.
How do I use the banking partner reference number?
Give the banking partner reference number to your recipient. They can use the banking partner reference number to see where the transfer is once it’s shown as completed on your Wise account.
The recipient will need to give this number to the recipient’s bank if they get in touch with them.
In different countries, banks might call it something else. For example, in India, banks sometimes call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number, or a transaction reference number.",[]

Whether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.
Log in to your Wise account
Log in to your Wise account
Go to Home to see your activity list
Go to Home to see your activity list
Find the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending

You can cancel your transfer if:

Your money’s on its way to us
Your money’s on its way to us
Your money’s being processed

We’ll send the money back to you, and you can set up another transfer using the correct bank details.
Learn how to cancel your transfer
Contact your recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or if your transfer is complete.
Our conversion process is fast and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once a transfer is marked as complete, the money is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. So if you don’t see the option to cancel:
Get in touch with the person you’re paying
Get in touch with the person you’re paying
Tell them how you got their bank details wrong

Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise
Ask them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise
Tip: If the bank sends your money back to us, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct bank details, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.
If you’re paying by Swift and your recipient's bank returns the money to us, you can only get a refund. We’ll send you an email asking to choose between a refund to your Wise balance or external bank account.","[{'text': 'Learn how to cancel your transfer', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2971625/i-want-to-cancel-a-transfer-i-havent-paid-for'}, {'text': 'Swift', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2553074/paying-by-swift'}]"

When you turn on Interest, you can still spend and send your money at any time.
However, there’s a processing time of up to 2 working days when you transfer over 12,000 EUR in one day from Interest balances or Jars. This is to help us keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.
It can sometimes be much quicker than 2 working days — we’ll give you a delivery estimate when you set up your transfer.

It doesn't include spending with your card, ATM withdrawals, scheduled transfers, or direct debits.
Making multiple transfers
You can make multiple transfers in one day without processing time as long as the total is 12,000 EUR or less.
However, it works differently if you transfer multiple amounts that bring you over 12,000 EUR. For example, if you send 10,000 EUR in the morning and then 8,000 EUR later the same day:
the 10,000 EUR transfer should arrive without added delay
the 10,000 EUR transfer should arrive without added delay
the 8,000 EUR transfer will have an added processing time of up to 2 working days
the 8,000 EUR transfer will have an added processing time of up to 2 working days
If you’re transferring in a different currency
The daily limits will be the equivalent of your local currency for that day. For example, if you’re based in the EEA but need to transfer USD, your threshold will be based on our exchange rate for EUR to USD for that day.
Other things can affect the arrival time
The estimated arrival time for your transfer might also be affected by other things, such as the country you’re sending to and any required security checks. This is always the case with sending money with Wise.

Why we have this processing time
Unlike many other providers, we want you to have easy access to your invested money.
When you turn on Interest, you’re investing in units in a fund. When you transfer money, we need to sell some of these units to cover the transfer. This takes a couple of days though, so to help you transfer without delay we use Wise’s money while we sell your units.
By having this 2 working day processing time for transfers over 12,000 EUR, we can sell the correct portion of your share in the fund to cover the transfer. This helps us to keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.","[{'text': 'how to avoid unexpected processing time', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/4Ofx8VSTCypxbfo1rEUa5g/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-interest-transfers'}, {'text': 'Find out what affects transfer times', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-take'}]"

the 100,000 GBP transfer should arrive without added delay
the 80,000 GBP transfer will have an added processing time of up to 5 working days
the 80,000 GBP transfer will have an added processing time of up to 5 working days
If you’re transferring in a different currency
The daily limits will be the equivalent of your local currency for that day. For example, if you’re based in the UK but need to transfer USD, your threshold will be based on our exchange rate for GBP to USD for that day.
Other things can affect the arrival time
The estimated arrival time for your transfer might also be affected by other things, such as the country you’re sending to and any required security checks. This is always the case with sending money with Wise.

Why we have this processing time
Unlike many other providers, we want you to have easy access to your invested money.
When you turn on Stocks, you’re investing in units in a fund. When you transfer money, we need to sell some of these units to cover the transfer. This takes a couple of days though, so to help you transfer without delay we use Wise’s money while we sell your units.
By having this 5 working day processing time for transfers over 100,000 GBP, we can sell the correct portion of your share in the fund to cover the transfer. This helps us to keep your service fee low and offer you the best rate possible.","[{'text': 'Find out how to avoid unexpected processing time.', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2NdFl9rnCXOd38zIL0wYgQ/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-stocks-transfers-uk-business'}, {'text': 'Interest transfers', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/6H57JNPrt8I590yAYJix7B/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-uk-business-customers'}, {'text': 'Find out what affects transfer times', 'url': 'https://wise.com/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-take'}]"

https://wise.com/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift,Sending with Swift,"If you're sending a payment in a currency that's different from your recipient's bank's currency, you'll need to send it by Swift. An example is if you're sending USD to a country outside of the US.
Swift payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent with the Swift international payment network. The Swift international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via Swift payment.
Find out how to send to recipients with Swift, what the fees are, and how long it can take.
When do you use Swift?
We pay out via Swift when you send:
USD to countries outside the US
USD to countries outside the US
GBP to countries outside the UK
GBP to countries outside the UK
More than 1 million JPY to any country
More than 1 million JPY to any country
EUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA
EUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA
What do I need to know when sending Swift?
Here's a few things that can help make your transfer experience smoother.
When sending out a Swift payment, always use an IBAN when possible. You can use our IBAN checker to see if a country supports IBAN numbers and what its structure means.
If you've sent a Swift payment to a recipient in the past, you can select them from the available recipients list when setting up your payment.
First, always ask your recipient to double-check the details they're giving you are correct before you use them.
Our system then uses recipient validation to check that the details are valid and comply with Swift rules. When you start setting up the payment, the system checks the name, address, bank account number, and the Swift or BIC number of your recipient. This helps us prevent rejected transfers or delays with your payments and give you a better Swift experience.
It's easy to type information into the wrong field. But this can lead to errors and delays. For example, in the account number field, only input the account number — not any additional details, like your recipient's name or Swift code.
Make sure you don't use any spaces or separators in the number.
What are the fees for Swift payments?
We’ll charge you to send out a Swift payment — check our pricing page on the latest fees for your region.
When the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their own handling fees. We can't control what extra costs other banks apply.
Learn more about correspondent bank fees
How long can a Swift transfer take?
Swift payments usually take 1–6 working days to reach their destination, but it's possible they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.
My recipient's account details didn't work
If the system spots incorrect details, it'll prompt you to review them before continuing with the payment.
There are some unique account numbers that sometimes don't work with our system. If you're sure it's a valid number — contact us with a proof of account from your recipient. We'll try to create a custom rule for your situation. A proof of account validity can be an invoice or statement from the recipient's bank that shows the bank account number.

These checks usually take 2–10 working days, but occasionally they can take longer. We’ll usually update the delivery estimate to take this into account, so check it to see when your transfer will arrive.
We have to do these checks because Wise is a regulated financial institution. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with your transfer.
So, if your transfer is taking a little longer, don’t worry. If we need any extra information from you, we’ll get in touch. Just keep an eye on your email — including your spam inbox — for any messages from us. And you can check your transfer progress in the Activity section of your Wise account.
