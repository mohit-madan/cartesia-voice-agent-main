To check the money tracker:\nLog in to your Wise account\nLog in to your Wise account\nClick Details on the transfer you\u2019d like to track\nClick Details on the transfer you\u2019d like to track\nToday, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.\nWe might need to verify you\nDepending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.\nThe recipient\u2019s bank might be processing the transfer\nWhen the money tracker says Transfer Sent, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient\u2019s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you\u2019re sending to. Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.\nThere\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details\nSometimes, transfers get delayed because there\u2019s a mistake in the recipient\u2019s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they\u2019ll send the money back to us and we\u2019ll ask you to send it again.\nIf your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient\u2019s details. Here\u2019s what to do if you made a mistake.\nIt's a weekend or holiday\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\nWhat do I do now?\nIf we have paid out your money, but it hasn\u2019t settled in your recipient\u2019s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient\u2019s bank.\nGo to\u00a0Home to see your activity list\nGo to\u00a0Home to see your activity list\nClick on Details on the relevant transfer\nClick on Details on the relevant transfer\nClick Get PDF receipt\nClick Get PDF receipt\nSend the PDF to your recipient\u2019s bank\nSend the PDF to your recipient\u2019s bank\n",

    "content": "When you make a transfer, we\u2019ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it\u2019ll arrive, or why it\u2019s delayed.\nWise says that my transfer\u2019s due to arrive today.\nGreat! Really that means your money should\u2019ve arrived already. We say that it\u2019s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.\nMy recipient\u2019s details may be\u00a0wrong.\nSmall things like typos in names \u2014 for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time.\u00a0However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.\nIf something like an account number is\u00a0wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we\u2019ll let you know straight away.\nTransfers on weekends and holidays.\nNot all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you\u2019re sending money to.\nBut in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.\nThat means, if your money\u2019s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient\u2019s account until the next working day. We\u2019re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.\nMy recipient says the money hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\nWe hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven\u2019t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:\nThe sender name they\u2019re looking for.\u00a0Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\nThe sender name they\u2019re looking for.\u00a0Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name.

    "title": "Why do some transfers take longer?",
    "content": "We try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes, and what to do.\nWe\u2019ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive, and send you updates via email once the transfer is on its way. Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.\nTrack your transfer to see the latest status.\nPayment method\nHow you paid for your transfer can affect how long it takes to send, because some options are faster than others. We\u2019ll always show you how long each payment method takes when you\u2019re setting up your transfer. Conversion between currencies can always take up to 2 working days.\nPaying by card\nIf you paid by card, we can start your transfer straight away, because card payments are usually instant. They might sometimes be pending, so you can check your transfer status by logging into Wise.\nPaying by bank\nBanks can take longer depending on your currency. For example, it might take 2 working days to process your transfer, and longer if it falls on a holiday.\nPaying by Swift\nIf you make a Swift transfer, which is a global payment that uses multiple banks, we\u2019ll need to wait until we get your money. This could take 2\u20135 working days, and we can\u2019t control the speed as other banks are involved.\nPayment methods are also different for different currencies. Some currencies are faster than others, so read our Help Centre articles on your currency to find out how long yours can take.\nLearn more about Swift transfers\nWeekends and holidays\nOnce we\u2019ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control \u2014 so this might slow down the process.\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\nSo if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.\nMistake in your recipient details\nWe all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.\nSecurity checks\nFrom time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. These additional checks can add extra time to your transfer.\nYou can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.\nBanks processing payments\nAfter we send your money out to your recipient\u2019s bank, the bank will then process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others \u2014 it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money\u2019s out of our system, so we can\u2019t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.\nYour recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the transfer receipt with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can\u2019t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly.\nWe\u2019re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you\u2019d like to help, you can let us know when the money arrived.",

    "title": "Sending with Swift",
    "content": "If you're sending a payment in a currency that's different from your recipient's bank's currency, you'll need to send it by Swift. An example is if you're sending USD to a country outside of the US.\nSwift payments, also called international wires, are a type of international transfer sent with the Swift international payment network.\u00a0The Swift international payment network is one of the largest financial messaging systems in the world. Wise can send or receive certain currencies via Swift payment.\nFind out how to send to recipients with Swift, what the fees are, and how long it can take.\nWhen do you use Swift?\nWe pay out via Swift when you send:\nUSD to countries outside the US\nUSD to countries outside the US\nGBP to countries outside the UK\nGBP to countries outside the UK\nMore than 1 million JPY to any country\nMore than 1 million JPY to any country\nEUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA\nEUR to banks that are not part of SEPA and countries outside of SEPA\nWhat do I need to know when sending Swift?\nHere's a few things that can help make your transfer experience smoother.\nWhen sending out a Swift payment, always use an IBAN when possible. You can use our IBAN checker to see if a country supports IBAN numbers and what its structure means.\nIf you've sent a Swift payment to a recipient in the past, you can select them from the available recipients list when setting up your payment.\nFirst, always ask your recipient to double-check the details they're giving you are correct before you use them.\nOur system then uses recipient validation to check that the details are valid and comply with Swift rules. When you start setting up the payment, the system checks the name, address, bank account number, and the Swift or BIC number of your recipient. This helps us prevent rejected transfers or delays with your payments and give you a better Swift experience.\nIt's easy to type information into the wrong field. But this can lead to errors and delays. For example, in the account number field, only input the account number \u2014 not any additional details, like your recipient's name or Swift code.\nMake sure you don't use any spaces or separators in the number.\nWhat are the fees for Swift payments?\nWe\u2019ll charge you to send out a Swift payment \u2014 check our pricing page on the latest fees for your region.\nWhen the money is in transit, correspondent banks in between may also deduct their own handling fees.\u00a0We can't control what extra costs other banks apply.\nLearn more about correspondent bank fees\nHow long can a Swift transfer take?\nSwift payments usually take 1\u20136 working days to reach their destination, but it's possible they can take longer due to time differences between the sending and receiving country, or multiple intermediary banks involved with delivering your money to us.\nMy recipient's account details didn't work\nIf the system spots incorrect details, it'll prompt you to review them before continuing with the payment.\nThere are some unique account numbers that sometimes don't work with our system. If you're sure it's a valid number \u2014 contact us with a proof of account from your recipient. We'll try to create a custom rule for your situation. A proof of account validity can be an invoice or statement from the recipient's bank that shows the bank account number.\n*The speed or your transfers always depends on individual circumstances, and may not be available for all transactions",

    "content": "While we try to process all transfers as fast as possible, sometimes we have to carry out checks on them, to keep your money safe.\nThese checks usually take 2\u201310 working days, but occasionally they can take longer. We\u2019ll usually update the delivery estimate to take this into account, so check it to see when your transfer will arrive.\nWe have to do these checks because Wise is a regulated financial institution. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with your transfer.\nSo, if your transfer is taking a little longer, don\u2019t worry. If we need any extra information from you, we\u2019ll get in touch. Just keep an eye on your email \u2014 including your spam inbox \u2014 for any messages from us.
